# ðŸš€ Backend Development with JavaScript

This project is a part of my learning journey into **backend development** using **JavaScript**, specifically focusing on **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It includes core backend concepts, practical implementations, and structured code to demonstrate how a modern backend server is built from scratch.
